[Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) is a static site generator that is written in JavaScript and runs on Node.js. It is a simple tool that is easy to use and configure. It is also very flexible and can be used with many different templating languages.

Here is a very messy configuration file for this site that hasn't been cleaned up yet. It is a good example of extending Eleventy's default configuration and extending common template libraries such as Nunjucks and Liquid to render HTML and Markdown.
