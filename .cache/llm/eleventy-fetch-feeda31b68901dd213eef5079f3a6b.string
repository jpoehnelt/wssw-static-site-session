 Static site generators have been around for a while, but they have become increasingly popular in recent years. This is due in part to the rise of the headless CMS, which allows developers to create and manage content without having to worry about the front-end design. Static site generators are also becoming more popular because they are a more secure and performant alternative to traditional dynamic websites.
