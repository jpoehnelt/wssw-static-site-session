 Eleventy is a simpler static site generator. It’s an alternative to tools like Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby. Unlike most static site generators, Eleventy doesn’t require a build step. Instead, it uses a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler to generate pages as they’re requested. This makes Eleventy incredibly fast, and it also means that you can develop your site without having to wait for a build to complete.
