 Web components are a set of features that allow you to create custom, reusable HTML elements. They consist of three main parts:

HTML templates define the structure of the element.
CSS styles define the look and feel of the element.
JavaScript code defines the behavior of the element.
Web components can be used to create anything from simple buttons to complex widgets. They are a powerful way to extend the HTML language and create new and innovative user interfaces.
