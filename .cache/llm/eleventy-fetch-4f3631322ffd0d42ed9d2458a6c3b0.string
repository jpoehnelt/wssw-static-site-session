 Jamstack is a modern web development architecture that pairs well with SSG (Static Site Generators). It emphasizes the use of pre-rendered static pages and APIs to deliver fast, secure, and scalable websites. SSGs are used to generate static HTML pages from templates and data, while Jamstack provides a framework for building websites using these static pages and APIs. This combination allows for improved performance, security, and scalability, as well as a better developer experience.
