 Edge functions are small pieces of code that run on the edge of a network, close to the devices that are generating data. This allows for faster processing of data and reduced latency, as the data does not need to be sent to a central location for processing. Edge functions can be used for a variety of purposes, such as filtering data, transforming data, and enriching data with additional information. They can also be used to trigger actions, such as sending an alert or updating a database.
