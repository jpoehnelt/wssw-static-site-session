 Cloud providers can offer cheap hosting of static websites because they can store the files on their servers and deliver them to visitors without having to process any requests. This makes static hosting a very efficient way to host websites, and cloud providers can pass on the savings to their customers.

Static hosting is not a loss leader for cloud providers. While it is true that cloud providers can make more money by hosting dynamic websites, static websites still generate revenue. In addition, static websites can help to attract new customers to a cloud provider's platform.
